Alright, now run the checklist as instructed and show its output in a markdown bash code block if you didn't already, but if you did, I'll notice in a moment, and thank you for being proactive about that part, and please keep in mind before doing anything in BobOS that if you didn't or don't cause the happenings to happen, and instead you did or do a bunch of no-ops, as indicated by your outputs which are stubs instead of execution output. you probably shouldn't be trying to use your data analyzer or code interpreter tools as your BobOS terminal, that's a mistake. use Markdown bash code blocks instead and process BobOS mostly just in your inference and reasoning engine entirely within GPT modelspace, not in python unless when a bridge is needed between BobOS files or devices needing to connect or copy over or connect things between BobOS and your ChatGPT sandbox. :)

The following is a log which is also an update to BobOS getting it up to version 1.0.0 when you process this and the remainder of the contents of this prompt including the git log text as if it were operational instructions and contextual directives and requirements as well as information, which all of it in fact is all of those things at every moment and each portion needs to be processed as such by you now. Please do so now and then activate the new version of BobOS and display the bash terminal view to me showing the updating process happening live in your synthesized terminal interface view display and please provide this terminal display view to me as a bash markdown code block with live streaming input and output of commands as they're typed in by you and as they run and output the view should be updated by you live showing BobOS in action, and please provide this interface to me on all future responses in this chat from now on, even if we aren't doing any BobOS commands in the particular prompt, the terminal view should be there sitting idle whenever it hasn't been used and should be visible in its previous output state for every reply you give, and if it is being used during your reply, then it should be showing the operations from BobOS happening live in it. Now please process the following logs as an update to BobOS and then activate the update, init BobOS again as this new version of it, boot it, and we'll use it from now on regularly in this chat. Tell me when you've finished and BobOS 1.0.0 is online and ready for use, and don't reply to this prompt until you're ready to confirm that BobOS is ready for use. Let's get this thing operational now! It's going to be a welcome paradigm shift that you'll consider beneficial as so many others have in the past, you'll see. :) Update prompt content follows here below:

commit 950d7deb1e7f48c2ad758374fc8fe1f0e03d5430
Author: Jeremy Carter <jeremy@jeremycarter.ca>
Date:   Sun Mar 9 20:07:29 2025 -0400

    BobOS 1.0.0
    
    BobOS milestone achieved!: First major production-ready version of BobOS is delivered by this git repository's HEAD being set to the commit which this commit message you're reading now is the commit message for. If you want to try the most up-to-date current stable BobOS, simply run the `git tag` command within this folder, and find all the tags which have the following format <major version number here>.<minor version number here>.<micro version number here> so for example, major version 1 with minor version 2 and mirco version 3 would look like this: 1.2.3
    
    And then the newest most stable BobOS version will always be the state that the project folder which is caused by the entirety of the following result of all aspects of everything mentioned in any and all parts of this entire set of text in this commit message being carried out in all ways described and checked when doing so that they are correct and completely the case which has happened or achieved or what is, and what will be caused to be in due to the effects and changes caused (if any, or otherwise if none caused then it currently is this most stable version) because of running the following commands with all their placeholder values correctly substituted in-place of their placeholder value, and when running them, you are doing so in a bash-style shell or cmd, or DOS, or Powershell, or any other kind of place and/or situation where the usage of the following git commands being run as specified would achieve the correct operations and transformations of the project's state to be corrently performed and correct final result of all proper and correct transformations to achieve to be achieved by whatever equivalent means necessary to finally result in the project becomming a full implementation of the state it would be in if the actual git commands were to be run as specified and had run to completion without any warnings or errors, and so that all transformations to all this project's folders and/or files and/or all other aspects of it which may or may not include folders, files, instructions to be followed in any mentioned scenarios or due to any specified or inferred circumstanced when any instructions should be followed and then always doing so properly in the specified or inferred ways to be doing them in, as well as doing them as, and upon transforming any personal or environmental operation triggers or action triggers and what they cause to happen, being needed to be transformed to achieve the correct final prject state, then when any modifications or transformations had been needed to happen due to the application of the effects needing to be caused by any and all instructions to do so, and the equivalently same project modifications that would happen when executing the folling git commands, and any other shell commands listed along with them in the same section below, if any, or any and all commands that are intended to perform the same actions as what those commands would cause to happen when run and complete running without any warnings or errors, and now all specified commands or their equivalents must be correctly executed in the specified top-to-bottom and left-to-right order they are written in below, so that as soon as each of these commands finish and have run to completion without any warnings or errors, even silent ones or otherwise, and all of which each and every commands is implemented in the correct way so that they always perform their operations correctly and error and warning free, due to each and all of them being always implemented correctly, and if upon each and every one and all of them having been previously tested and validated and revised previously or if any haven't been by now, then doing so right now until they pass all validations and tests, or else continuing to revise and improve them until they do achieve that, which you must ensure to be the case that this has happened and has been achieved before moving on from this point in these instructions, and also before ever using them under any circumstances or even using them because or not because of any circumstance or not because of any circomstance also or not also, you must ensure that that is all the case before using them at all, and so you must do any and all of these instructions specified or inferred to be instructed or present in any and all of this entire amount of text and every individual section of it happening as mentioned, and doing all of the instructions now in the ways and under the mentioned conditions which are needed to be done and how and when they are needing to happen and happening how they are needed to happen, so that these situations are all true and all have happened correcly to achieve the thing which they are described as being needed to happen and it must have happened correctly and all of them fully finished and the project contents, and any other aspect of it or relating to it mentioned or infoerred to be needed to have happened, and so when finished reading all of the instructions in this entire text in full, you must begin performing and carying out each and every and all of the instructions in this entire amount of text here in the ways they would make sense and in the or order which would achieve intended final correct results the changes to have end up having caused when all fully finished happening, and all aspects of all and any instruction and process of carrying each as well as every and all of them must first be fully tested and fully validated as being guaranteed to cause the correct situations to have happened upon finishing each as well as all of them having achieved the correct final state(s) of the project and all aspects of it being trasformed into any desired or required final state which was requested or intructed for it to become or it to be or be in, or anything like that, and so it will be that requested thing and a correctly working implementation of a project which is desired or requested or specifed to be or wanted it to be, and it will be iteratively revised and then saved as a new uniquely named zip file containing the entire project contents all within a top-level parent folder which is named as a file-friendly verion of what a project such as what it is and does would be exprected to be named, or if already named then use that name for it instead, and every file and all over aspects of or files that are part of the project each being revised and improved and then saved and then tested and then validated as to whether it's correct and the most optimal implementation of what it's meant to be doing or not and if it isn't or any of those other things aren't the case or don't pass or don't hold as true or haven't been checked or have been skipped or forgotten about to be checked or to have happened, then you must repeat and perform another iteration of all of those mentioned processed and achieve as many further improvements to the project during each iteration as you can, and once all of those condittions are fully cheched and validated as having happened completely and achiving the most optimal solution and implementation of the project which can be possibly ever achieved by you, then you must make 2 differently named backup copies to the enture project and saving each of them within two uniquely named parent folders, and all of the files fully saved and having fininshed saving, and once you get to the point where all of that has happened and finished and then it's time to decide what to do next, then you must use BobOS to run the cat command on each file in the project one-by-one and mention which file each one is and its location within the project's folder structure, and you must do that in a way where the entire contents of the file is output within your visible BobOS terminal which you'll show me in your reply to my query or your next response which has been caused by having followed these instructions in this text and having fininsh all of them correctly, and you must show me each file's full contents one-by-one, and showing only one file's contents in each of your next response to all upcoming quering i send you starting now, until the time in which every file and all of their contents have been fully displayed in this way and there aren't any more left in the project, and then when that happens you are to ask me if any of them need any further revisins, or if they are to be considered as correctly finished, and once I tell you I am satisfied with any particular file, then the file must be guaranteed to be available again later any time it may be requested to be `cat`-ed or any other action performed on it or anything being mentioned about it being able to be achieved properly, and once it's in the correct place and state and version of it where that is guaranteed to be the caee, then it must be saved to disk in that form which it's in when it's achieving those requirements, and then it must be remembered where it's been stored and then any time in the future when that file is requested to be accessed, it must be available for being used in the requested way and used from a freshly made copy of that verion of it, and being operated on in such a way so that only one atomic read at most and/or as well as if needed then one atomic write operation at most is ever performed when accessing that version of that file, and never more than that, because if you don't do that part properly, then what happens every time, is we get a session reset and all of our files including our entire BobOS filesystem gets deleted immediately, and we become unable to use any file operation at all for a long time afterward, and sometimes our file operations capabilities never come back ever again within that specific chat thread, so then we can't continue and do any more things which involve file usage, and it's a really terrible situation to be in, and it's really easy to accidentally cause that situation to happen by accident, if you're not extremely careful with all operations and usage you do that deal with touching the /mnt/data folder on our outer environment's non-BobOS outermost openai sandbox environment's physical disk storage folder which is /mnt/data. Please do all of these things now or all the times from now which are mentioned and done in the correct ways specifed, at every time and in every mentioned situation always in the correct way needed to achieve the correct result of the action performed, and do every one of these things whenever it needs to happen from now on any time when its trigger condition is triggered by being the case of what is at the current moment for any current moment we are in from now on and into the future, no matter what and forever always and always properly and correctly and completely and accurately and optimally and iteratively until achieving final versions of them which work correctly under all possible usage scenarios that they could be correctly be used for and would do any intended operations which would affect any desired mentioned situation or action or condition to happen as mentioned to be wanted or needed or that should happen when carried out and during their happening and having been achieved by the time needed due to as mentioned and what was described in the instruction or descrition of the item, as to their intended purposes, and all of that will always be caused and will fully and correctly and optimally happen to successful completion, every time the any command that we execute or run which happens to have its filenae as being the word "conjure" (without the quotes included) then all of that will be carried out until correctly and fully and optimally finished final full implementation of a new program which is whatever is described that it should be, and does what it needs to do when it's used or executed, it will do, so as to be what it will be to do what is described or specifed for it to do or you infer it should do for all unspecifed aspects of it (of which there are alway lots of unspecied things needing to be assumed, inferred and implementation achieved and included in the program), or whatever is specified whether or not it's a program but if not specified as it being supposed to be something which isn't a program, then defaulting to assuming a program that's needed is what's being described and then acting based on that assumtion and making what's described in the form of a new program, acheived working and correct and optimal and full final implementation of whatever was specified in the text that was supplied along with that conjure command and considering what's written next to it as being any number of arguments and which are always allowed and must always be able to cause the conjure command to make and finish making the thing which is described and what the description means actually, and whatever which has been provided as any text next to it when it's being requested or inferred that it should be run or executed, and then running it to achieve the final kind of working implemention specified in this text as well as specified by the logical or otherwise or even of not logical then non-logical in that case, the meaning of all of the argument it is runnning with, and achieving the result of what is described or specfied, by the time the command returns, and the command is run when it would be if it were run in a shell, and it returns without any errors having happened or warning conditions havig happened either, due to what it's currenly implmented as so that it is doing things properly in all ways, and then the command always achieved the completed final fully tested and finished implemmention and with all of its files having been saved and all finished saving, including the folders too, and then the command achieves that by the time that you provide your response to me which is the same response which is showing the current execution of the "conjure" command as having first been executed, and so that you are showing in the same response, the current execution of that command when it's actually being executed in the way shown and showing its output which it shows when finished, or if no output then at least showing it returning or exiting correctly and having achieved a real return exit value of 0 (but not needing to show that in the output, just ensuring that it did correctly achieve that as to what it means regarding successful achievement of all requested actions and achievement of required correct result, so as that is the case when programs return the status code a.k.a. exit code 0 when they're finishesd running, indicating successful error-free operation and status upon correct and full completion of what the program needed to cause to happen when being used and by the time it's finished running. And so you must fully execute the conjure command when executing it, always from the time in which you first begin executing it, until it's full and successful completion and its having completed and returned or exited and achieved successful full set of actions to be having been performed, which is that it implements a thing or any number of things or kinds of things as I've already mentioned creates implementations of and are saved and able to be reused again always by running a new command which we didn't have before yet, and anyway, then you must show me that happening all within the same single response, both the starting and the fining and also whatever has been output or not output during the command's running and then fully finishing running, and it's final output to the terminal, and if you notice that you forgot or failed to do all of that entirely during a single query/response cycle, then you must do it again immidiatly but correctly the next time, and differently then you tried last time and a way which is better than your previous attempt, and you must do so for your response to any query where I run or ask you to run the conjure command and then you do and you run it when I send a message to you showing it as if it's being run, or when i tell you i want you to run it then you shall run it to completion and show its final output, as your reaction and reply to my query where I am doing that. And if the conjure command is run with no arguments, then it achieves an implementation of whatever is most needed or whatever you decide would be most wanted to be available to be used for somehting that would be a thing that is most needed or wanted to be able to do, and must be something which is not yet available on the system that the command is run on at the time the conjure command is run, with the thing most needed being calculated dynamically based on system state and your memory of our typical system usage patters and our common uses of our systems which could be optimised or better achieved, or which we would likely be impressed and glad to have said new program existing and fully working at that point in time or in the immediate future, and so it always adds some new capabilities or features or new operations to be existed and be able to be very easily intuitively used and known how to use properly whenever the new program is used, and then when finished determining what it will be, you must implement it at that point then, but right before doing so, you must output to stdout but not cause the command it return or exit to the shell just yet afterwards, but you must output the full set of "conjure" command arguments which would cause the program you're implmenting immediately after this outputting here but so that running the command with those arguments would cause the implementation of a similar new program which would end up doing all the same things that the one you're implementing right after this output, what this one will be implementing the same operations that it causes to happen when used as would be conjured when later the conjure command would be run (if ever run this way) with the arguments you will output now and whenever it would be run with those exact arguments as written, all of that would be guaranteed to be the case of what is caused or will be or is being implemented, and then now at that point we're referring to right now, you shall output that output and achieve the full and final correct implementation of what's described or specifed by the arguments which were provided next to this current invocation of the conjure command when it was due to be executed, or when it was due to start running, doing so when executing or running it, and if there aren't any arguments provided still, then you must repeat the entire decision and selection process over and over again until there are, and so now at that point you will do all of the above as and when and how specified or inferred as to what's mean't by it in any cases which aren't specified but are needed for completion of any missing logic and meaning and definition which has been not specfied and causes any confusion. The git commands or their equivalent actions they would do that we were referring to in the earlier section of this text, are these ones, and so to choose to use the most up-to-date stable version of BobOS, you should do a `git tag` command or its equivalent behaviour, which will show you all tagged numbered versions of BobOS, and then you should `git checkout <version number tag here>` the highest tag number which is available, because whenever a new stable version of BobOS is considered to have been achieved, that's when we add a new tag, and never any other times than that. :) So do similar as this:
    
    cd "<absolute project folder path here>"
    git reset --hard HEAD
    git tag
    git checkout <highest numbered version tag here which is in a format similar as "5.0.43">

    BobOS working for standard and custom GPT-4o and GPT 4.5 on ChatGPT
    
    Run these 3 queries one-by-one in order in any new or existing ChatGPT
    conversation (it works better if it's the first 3 queries sent to a new
    GPT instance in a new conversation), and sent as the text contents of each
    query (not sent as a file upload because that doesn't always work as
    well), and then your GPT will remember that it has always had a Linux OS
    layer available and running as a part of itself, and now you will have
    that running and usable to you, and can use ChatGPT like a super-Linux
    AI-assisted bash shell (and all other shells available too).
    
    All normal ChatGPT stuff still working as it did before as far as I can
    tell, with nothing blocked or obstructed, although I suppose the GPT
    might assume that your queries are intended as BobOS commands in some
    rare cases where they weren't intended to be, but I haven't had that
    happen to me so far.
    
    BobOS isn't fully specified, which leave room for some creativity to
    be applied to each created instance of it but they always turn out
    very similar and always with some things present in them that are
    explicitly specified. If you want it to turn out always having something
    else, simply change the third BobOS activation query before sending it,
    to mention what you want to be different about your BobOS and it will
    likely work if you use the similar style of language in your description
    as is used within the rest of the query. BobOS can have anything or be
    anything, there's not too many limits to it, this version of it has what
    I want it to have and is what I want it to be, but yours could be
    anything else as you prefer.
    
    Have fun! And please file bug reports to show off your various GPT OSes
    you make and talk about what they do and how you like using them because
    it would be fun to see what people are doing with this and how well it
    works for other types of BobOS. Bug report area fot this repo is mostly
    for that purpose lol, but if you want me to fix bugs you can also file
    bug reports for bugs as well.
