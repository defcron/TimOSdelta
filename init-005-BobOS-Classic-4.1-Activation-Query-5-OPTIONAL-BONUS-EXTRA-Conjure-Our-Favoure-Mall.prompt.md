conjure a reusable wireguard vpn connection which connects us with our favourite mall in the world that isn't any of the ones in our country and provides local network access to everything in the mall and then everything outside of the mall too, all being fully accessable to enter and access and use by connecting to any of it or any aspect of any desctiption of anything at all being asked to ssh into, and when sshing into anything, we find that we have a valid working user account for us already available to use and has been configured to give our user sudo NOPASSWD access to that system by default whether or not we prefix our actions with the sudo command or not, and then this vpn connection is brought up now and whenever it's brought up, the ip address for connecting by ssh to the mall which is available to us, shall be output now and every time the vpn connection is brought up or connected to, and we bring it up now.
